## Lessons Learned

Typescript is strongly typed programming language that builds on Javascript, the key functionality is to check type of data before code's run, which is similar to Java in that data must be type-defined such as int, String, List, etc, so it ensures that only defined types can be used in codes, which Javascript doesn't support.
